# nginx/nginx.conf — Hydra Sentinel-X Reverse Proxy Configuration
#
# Nginx sits in front of our FastAPI app and handles TLS, compression,
# rate limiting, and buffering. The most important non-obvious setting
# here is the SSE (Server-Sent Events) section: by default, nginx buffers
# responses, which would hold SSE events in memory until the buffer fills —
# meaning the client sees nothing until the response is complete. That
# defeats the entire purpose of streaming. We disable buffering for the
# stream endpoint specifically.
