HYDRA FULL DEPLOYMENT REPORT
========================================

1️⃣ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & HIERARCHY
----------------------------------------
ExecBoard (Top-tier) – Strategic oversight, risk management, execution command, and intelligence direction.
  Agents: Strategic_Visionary, Risk_Sovereign, Intelligence_Architect, Execution_Commander
  Role: Decide priorities, allocate resources, approve deployments.

DeptAdmins (Middle-tier) – Department administrators; implement ExecBoard decisions.
  Agents: Strategy_Admin, Risk_Admin, Execution_Admin, Intelligence_Admin
  Role: Manage task agents, monitor department KPIs, optimize operations.

Task Agents (Operational tier) – Execute market analysis, memory, prediction engines, trading, sentiment parsing.
  Agents: OrderBookAnalyzer, SentimentParser, BacktestRunner, ChartVision
  Role: Modular, specialized, constantly learning, reporting errors, and earning compute credits for autonomy and upgrades.

Delegation Flow: ExecBoard → DeptAdmins → Managers → Task Agents
Autonomy: Task agents can promote/reward lower ranks but cannot override ExecBoard or CEO authority.
Self-Optimization: Agents analyze failures, successes, adapt to improve efficiency.
